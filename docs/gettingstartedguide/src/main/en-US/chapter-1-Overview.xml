    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>This is the Getting Started Guide for Testable Architecture, and the supporting tools provided by project SAVARA. This guide starts with the installation instructions for the SAVARA tools.</para>
    <para>The remainder of the document is organised to reflect phases within the Testable Architecture Methodology, and how the current tools can be used in support of that methodology. The tools are still in development, and therefore not all phases will have tools, and the tools in some phases will not necessarily be complete.</para>
    <para>As an overview, the tools currently include capabilities for:</para>
